Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form?
It provides reinforcement of meaning for the content of the websites and forms.
For example, it helps search engines understand the meaning of a given website. 

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML?
This is especially helpful when a team is working on the same project.
By using similar semantics, it allows other programmers to jump into a project and understand what the direction of the project is.

What are some disadvantages?
The only disadvantage I can think of, is that it can make the semantics you choose either correct or incorrect. 
If similar semantics are used, it creates a right and wrong way of using them.
